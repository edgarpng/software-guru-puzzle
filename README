When this script is executed with an integer number between 0 and 1000 as a parameter, it prints all letters neccesary to write numbers up to that number in spanish.

Example:

ruby ooyala_puzzle.rb 3

output:
["c", "d", "e", "n", "o", "r", "s", "t", "u"]

since
0 = 'cero'
1 = 'uno'
2 = 'dos'
3 = 'tres'
in spanish
